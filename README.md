# Photobioreactor Design + ML-Based Simulation Log

## Project Overview
This project documents my ongoing work on integrating **photobioreactor (PBR) design** with **machine learning–assisted computer simulation**. It serves as a living workspace to collect ideas, record experiments, track progress, and gradually build a reproducible workflow that connects simulation insights with real experimental feedback.

Rather than a finished “product,” this repository is intended to be a long-term learning and research log that grows step by step.

## Why This Project Matters (Project Role)
The main purpose of this project is to support faster and more informed photobioreactor development by connecting three elements:

- **Design:** explore and iterate PBR structures and operating parameters (e.g., geometry, light distribution, mixing, mass transfer).
- **Simulation:** use computational models to predict performance and identify promising configurations before physical trials.
- **Machine Learning:** leverage data-driven methods to learn from simulation/experimental results, improve prediction accuracy, and guide optimization.

In short, this project aims to **reduce trial-and-error**, **improve design efficiency**, and **make iteration more systematic** through the combination of modeling, data, and experiments.

## What I Expect From Myself
This repository is also a personal commitment.

I hope I can:
- stay consistent and keep moving forward, even if progress is sometimes small;
- build good habits (clear notes, reproducible steps, honest reflections);
- be patient with learning, and improve the work quality over time.

**A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.**  
I will keep taking that step—again and again—and try my best to坚持下去.

## Structure (Suggested)
You may organize the repository like this:
- `notes/` — weekly notes, meeting takeaways, reading summaries
- `simulation/` — scripts, models, parameter studies
- `experiments/` — experimental plans, raw data, observations
- `ml/` — ML models, training code, evaluation
- `results/` — plots, reports, exported figures
- `docs/` — slides, drafts, references
